### Building the Resume

To compile the resume to a PDF, you will need a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer. You can also use Overleaf, an online LaTeX editor, to open and compile the `.tex` files.

#### Local Compilation

If you have a LaTeX distribution installed, you can compile the resume using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sherwinvishesh/Resume.git
cd Resume
pdflatex main.tex
```
This command will generate a resume.pdf file from the LaTeX source code.

#### Using Overleaf
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sherwinvishesh/Resume.git
   cd Resume
    
    ```
 2. Open `Main.tex`.
 3. Compile it using a LaTeX editor ([like Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), TeXstudio, etc.).

## Archive
The archive/ folder contains previous versions of my resume. Each subfolder within archive/ is named after the date or version of the resume it contains, along with a PDF and source code in LaTeX format.
